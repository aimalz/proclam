\title{The Photometric \textsc{LSST} Astronomical Time-series Classification Challenge (\textsc{PLAsTiCC}): Selection of a performance metric for classification probabilities balancing diverse science goals}

\maketitlepre

\begin{abstract}

  Open challenges are an effective route to promoting the development of novel techniques in astronomical data analysis.
  However, the probabilistic classifications appropriate to upcoming deep surveys, including the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope (\textsc{LSST}), are incompatible with the traditional metrics used on deterministic classifications.
  Furthermore, large survey collaborations like that of \textsc{LSST} may use the products of these challenges for diverse science objectives, indicating a need for a metric that balances a variety of goals.
  We describe the process used to develop an optimal performance metric for a challenge affected by both these issues in the context of the Photometric \textsc{LSST} Astronomical Time-series Classification Challenge (\textsc{PLAsTiCC}), an open competition aiming to identify promising methods for obtaining classification probabilities of transient and variable objects by engaging a broader community both within and outside astronomy.
  Using mock classification probability submissions exhibiting characteristic performance types anticipated of \textsc{PLAsTiCC}, we compare the sensitivity of two metrics of classification probabilities to the isolated systematics and combinations thereof, ultimately making the reassuring conclusion that multiple metrics yield qualitatively consistent results.
  Thus we choose as a metric for \textsc{PLAsTiCC} a weighted modification of the log-loss due to the availability of a meaningful interpretation and superior sensitivity to the most concerning potential failures of classification.
  We propose extensions of our procedure to ever more complex challenge goals and suggest some guiding principles for approaching the choice of a metric of probabilistic classifications.
