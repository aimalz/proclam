\title{The Photometric \textsc{LSST} Astronomical Time-series Classification Challenge (\textsc{PLAsTiCC}): Selection of a performance metric for classification probabilities balancing diverse science goals}

\maketitlepre

\begin{abstract}
  New techniques in astronomical data analysis often follow the challenge provided by large and complex data sets. Critical to refining these techniques are the metrics over which we can evaluate success or failure of a given method.
The photometric-only data that will be generated by the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope (\textsc{LSST}) will mean that classification of the myriad transient objects detected will be probabilistic, and need metrics that can account for the probabilities.
The diverse science goals of those working in \textsc{LSST} also creates a need for a metric that balances multiple goals.
%  Open challenges are an effective route to promoting the development of novel techniques in astronomical data analysis.
%  However, the probabilistic data products appropriate to upcoming deep surveys, including the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope (\textsc{LSST}), are incompatible with the traditional metrics used on deterministic classifications.
% TODO define probabilistic data product
%  Furthermore, large survey collaborations like that of \textsc{LSST} may use the products of these challenges for diverse science objectives, indicating a need for a metric that balances a variety of goals.
  We describe the process used to develop an appropriate global performance metric for a challenge affected by both these issues in the context of the upcoming Photometric \textsc{LSST} Astronomical Time-series Classification Challenge (\textsc{PLAsTiCC}), an open competition aiming to identify promising methods for obtaining classification probabilities of transient and variable objects by engaging the broader community outside astronomy.
  Using mock classification results, we ultimately make the reassuring discovery that multiple metrics yield qualitatively consistent results, enabling \textsc{PLAsTiCC} to choose a weighted modification of the log-loss as a metric due to the availability of a meaningful interpretation. Given a range of model classes of different sizes, we investigate how to weight metrics by class number. We suggest some guiding principles for approaching the choice of a metric of probabilistic classifications and propose extensions of our procedure to ever more complex challenge goals.
