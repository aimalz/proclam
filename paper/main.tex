\title{The Photometric \textsc{LSST} Astronomical Time-series Classification Challenge (\textsc{PLAsTiCC}): Selection of a performance metric for classification probabilities balancing diverse science goals}

\maketitlepre

\begin{abstract}

  Light curve classification is a high priority for the of transient and variable objects, a key step in any time-domain astronomy analysis.
  However, upcoming deep photometric surveys, including the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope (\textsc{LSST}), will produce a deluge of lower signal-to-noise data for which traditional labelings are inappropriate.
  Probabilistic classifications are more appropriate for the data but are incompatible with the traditional metrics used on deterministic classifications.
  Furthermore, large survey collaborations intend to use these classification probabilities for diverse science objectives, indicating a need for a metric that balances a variety of goals.
  We describe the process used to develop an optimal performance metric for an open classification challenge that seeks probabilistic classifications and must serve many scientific interests.
  The Photometric \textsc{LSST} Astronomical Time-series Classification Challenge (\textsc{PLAsTiCC}) is an open competition aiming to identify promising methods for obtaining classification probabilities of transient and variable objects by engaging a broader community both within and outside astronomy.
  Using mock classification probability submissions mimicing archetypes of those anticipated of \textsc{PLAsTiCC}, we compare the sensitivity of two metrics of classification probabilities under various weighting schemes, finding that they yield qualitatively consistent results.
  We choose as a metric for \textsc{PLAsTiCC} a weighted modification of the log-loss because it can be more meaningfully interpreted.
  Finally, we propose extensions of our procedure to ever more complex challenge goals and suggest some guiding principles for approaching the choice of a metric of probabilistic classifications.
