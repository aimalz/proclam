% intro and data
As part of the preparation for \plasticc\, we investigated the properties of metrics suitable for probabilistic light curve classifications in the absence of a single scientific goal.
Therefore, we sought a metric that avoids reducing classification probabilities to deterministic labels \changes{and is compatible with a multi-class, rather than binary (two-class), setting.
We did not consider some of the most popular metrics used in astronomy (such as accuracy, combinations of the true and false positive and negative rates, and AUC functions thereof) because they did not satisfy these criteria, even though it is in principle possible to extend such metrics for our situation.}
% In line with the goals of \plasticc, an important desideratum was to have a metric that tends to} reward a classifier's performance across all classes over a classifier that performs well on a small subset of the classes and poorly on others.
\changes{Our experimental design thus explores the response of potential metrics to simulated classification submissions from a set of mock classifier archetypes expected of generic transient and variable classifiers.}

% the metrics
\changes{We identified two metrics of multi-class classification probabilities established in the literature: the Brier score and the log-loss.}
The Brier score and the log-loss metrics are structurally and conceptually different, with wholly different interpretations.
The Brier score is a sum of square differences between probabilities;
the explicit penalty term is an attractive feature, but it treats probabilities as generic scores.
The log-loss on the other hand is readily interpretable \changes{as a measure of information}, meaning the metric itself could be propagated into forecasting the cosmological constraining power of \lsst, affecting the choice of observing strategy.

% weights
\changes{When evaluated with equal weight on each classified object,} both the Brier score and the log-loss metrics are susceptible to rewarding a classifier that performs well on the most prevalent class and poorly on all others, which fails to meet the needs of \plasticc's diverse motivations \changes{under the unavoidable population imbalances of astronomical data}.
\changes{To discourage competitors from neglecting rare classes,} we explored a weighted average of the metric values on a per-class basis as a possible mitigation strategy to incentivize classifying uncommon classes, effectively ``leveling the playing field'' in the presence of highly nonuniform class membership.
%\changes{%Such weights were taken to be the same for all objects in the same class.

% findings
On the basis of the mock classifier rankings, we found that both metrics reward the classifiers that are better and penalize those that are worse, where better and worse are defined by our common intuition, yielding the same rankings under either metric and demonstrating that both could be appropriate for \plasticc.
However, since only one could be selected, the log-loss was chosen due to its potential for interpretation after the conclusion of the challenge.
\changes{While modifyinging the log-loss metric to handle weights for different classes diminishes its interpretability, it can still be understood as information gain, subject to the value we as scientists place on knowledge of each class.}

% justifying limited choice of metrics to consider
\changes{The space of possible metrics we could have considered is truly unbounded, from traditional metrics of deterministic labels to established extensions thereof for probabilistic classifications to novel quantities tuned to any given science case.
Though there was no need to do a more extensive survey of metrics nor to devise new metrics for \plasticc, since both log-loss and Brier score passed the basic sanity tests for this application, further work remains to be done in optimally selecting probabilistic classification metrics in other astronomical contexts.}

We conclude by noting that care should be taken in planning future open challenges to ensure alignment between the challenge goals and the performance metric, so that efforts are best directed to achieve the challenge objectives.
It is our hope hope that this study of metric performance across a range of systematic effects and weights may serve as a guide to approaching the problem of identifying promising probabilistic classifiers for general science applications.
