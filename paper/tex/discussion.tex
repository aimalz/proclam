\section{Discussion}
\label{sec:discussion}
The goal of this work was to identify the metric most suited to \plasticc, which is a challenge focused on complete light curves similar to those anticipated from \lsst, with an emphasis on classification over all types, rather than focusing on any one class of scientific interest\footnote{At the conclusion of \plasticc, other metrics which reward accurate classification of particular classes or combinations of classes will be used to identify classification schemes that will be useful for more targeted science cases.}


As such, the \textit{log-loss metric} is the most well suited to the current \plasticc\ release. Future releases of \plasticc\ will focus on different challenges in transient classification, with metrics appropriate to rewarding those who address those challenges.

%The metrics investigated here are specific to \plasticc, in which participants compete to classify complete lightcurves similar to those anticipated of \lsst\ data releases, independent of the propagation of classification efficacy to specific science applications.

%There exist plans for future extensions of \plasticc, each aiming to address different problems and thus requiring a different metric appropriate to its goals.
% Additionally, there are other perspectives on what constitutes a good classifier, and those perspectives must be boiled down to a metric in order to identify a classifier that is best for the task.
We discuss approaches to identifying optimal metrics for these variations, which may be developed further in future work.
%=======
%\plasticc\ will use a single metric (log-loss), that we select based on its interpretability.
%This choice of metric, however, is specific to the goal of \plasticc, to identify a ``best in show'' classifier of complete light curves similar to those anticipated of \lsst\ data releases, independent of the propagation of classification efficacy to specific science applications.
%At the conclusion of \plasticc, the identities of the classes will become public, and we will consider science-motivated metrics on a per-class basis to identify ``best in class'' classifiers as well.
%There exist additional plans for future extensions of \plasticc, each aiming to address different problems and thus requiring a different metric appropriate to its goals.
%We proceed to very broadly discuss approaches to identifying optimal metrics for these variations, which may be developed further in future work.

\subsection{Early classification}
\label{sec:early}


Spectroscopic follow-up is only expected of a small fraction of \lsst's detected transients and variable stars due to limited resources for such observations. In addition to optical spectroscopic follow-up, photometric observations in various wavelength bands (near infrared, HST/JWST observations, X-ray and radio follow-up) will be key to build up a physical picture of the object, particularly as we enter the era of `multi-messenger' astronomy with the added possibility of gravitational wave signatures of some transients.
% , with resources focused towards objects already flagged as novel and interesting (by a classifier), or useful for cosmology, again using classification algorithms on photometric data.
Prompt follow-up observations are highly informative for fitting models to the light curves of familiar source classes and to characterizing anomalous light curves that could be signatures of never-before-seen classes that have eluded identification due to rarity or faintness. As such, decisions about follow-up resource allocation must be made quickly. A metric for an early classification challenge might factor in the number of available observations in the light curve.

% and under the constraint that resources wasted on a misclassification consume the budget remaining for future follow-up attempts. 

We note that the decision of whether to initiate follow-up observations is in general binary and deterministic\footnote{It is possible to conceive of non-binary decisions about follow-up resources; for example, one could choose between dedicating several hours on a spectroscopic instrument following up on one likely candidate or dedicating an hour each on several less likely candidates.  However, the conversion between classification posteriors and decisions is uncharted territory that we do not explore at this time.}, so deterministic classification may be appropriate for this application, but the ranked list provided by per-object classifications add more information about the ranking of different objects for follow-up.

Even within the scope of spectroscopic follow-up as a primary motivation for early light curve classification, the goals of model-fitting to known classes and discovery of new classes would likely not share an optimally metric. The critical question for choosing the most appropriate metric for any specific science goal motivating follow-up observations is to maximize information.

We provid two examples of cases of the kind of new information one needs to maximize from classification, and the qualities of a deterministic metric might enable it.
%We provide two examples of the information one seek to maximize and 

Supernova cosmology with spectroscopically confirmed light curves benefits from true positives, which contribute to the constraining power of the analysis by including one more data point; when the class one is interested in is as plentiful as SN Ia and our resources limited a priori, we may not be concerned by a high rate of false negatives.

% requires making a decision balancing the improved constraining power of including another SN Ia in the analysis, thereby constraining the cosmological parameters, so only true positives contribute information, and if we had a perfect classifier and standard follow-up spectroscopy resources, there would be a maximum amount of information about the cosmological parameters that could be gained in this way.
% Each false positive uses the same resources but adds no information about the cosmological parameters, and each false negative consumes no follow-up resources and deprives the Hubble diagram of one more data point.
False positives, on the other hand, may not enter the cosmology analysis, but they consume follow-up resources, thereby depriving the endeavor of the constraining power due to a single SN Ia.
A perfect classifier would lead to a maximum amount of information about the cosmological parameters conditioned on the follow-up resource budget.
For this scientific application, the metric must be chosen to not only maximize true positives but also to minimize false positives, and their relative impacts on the cosmological constraints can be quantified in terms of the information one would have about the cosmological parameters under different balances of true and false positives.
% balance the value of the information forgone by a false positive and the value of information forgone by a false negative, and the value placed on these is effectively weighted by the value we as researchers place on follow-up resources.

Anomaly detection also gains information only from true positives, but the cost function is different in that the potential gain of information from a true positive, since there is no information about undiscovered classes ahead of time. An example would be the recent detection of a kilonova, flagged initially by the detection of gravitational waves from an object.

Resource availability for identifying new classes is more flexible, increasing when new predictions or promising preliminary observations attract attention, and decreasing when a discovery is confirmed and the new class is established.
In this way, a false positive does not necessarily consume a resource that could otherwise be dedicated to a true positive, and the reward is great enough that resources would easily be allocated to observe the potential object.
% A false negative, on the other hand, represents forgoing an unbounded quantity of information, so minimizing the false negative rate is as important as maximizing the true positive rate.
% For a rare event like a kilonova, a false negative represents an unbounfalse positive does not appreciably reduce the amount of remaining information available to collect, but a false negative represents a large quantity of information forgone.
% Furthermore, r
% In this case, the information forgone by a false negative is significant compared to the information forgone by a false positive.
Thus, a metric tuned to anomaly detection would aim to minimize the false negative rate and maximize the true positive rate.

\subsection{Difficult light-curve classification}
\label{sec:difficult}

Photometric light curve classification may be challenging for a number of reasons, including the sparsity and irregularity of observations, the possible classes and how often they occur, and the distances and brightnesses of the sources of the light curves.
These factors may represent limitations on the information content of the light curves, but appropriate classifiers may be able to overcome them to a certain degree.

Though quality cuts can eliminate the most difficult light curves from entering samples used for science applications, such a practice discards information that may be of value under an analysis methodology leveraging the larger number of light curves included in a sample without cuts.
Thus, classification methods that perform well on light curves characterized by lower signal-to-noise ratios are specially important for exploiting the full potential of upcoming surveys like \lsst.

This version of \plasticc\ implements quality cuts to homogenize difficulty to some degree, and notions of classification difficulty may depend on information that will not be available until after the challenge concludes.
While the groundwork for a metric incorporating data quality has been laid by \citet{wu_radio_2018}, we defer to future work an investigation of this possibility.
